## About ##
I first got acquainted with web development in 2009. I started learning on my own at school. Then I made my first website for the company. Then I continued my studies at the institute, where my graduation work was the creation of a website for the Olympiad on IT-technologies of my institute. After there was a big break in programming. In 2020, he returned to layout. I started to work seriously, doing pet projects for my portfolio. I am currently studying online at The Rolling Scopes (RS School) on the JavaScript/Front-end course.


In the future, I want to become a cool front-end developer. I don't have a lot of commercial web development experience, but I'm very active and strive to be the best at what I do.
